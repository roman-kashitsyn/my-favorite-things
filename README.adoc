[quote,Mortimer J. Adler, How to Read a Book]
Of the few thousand such books there is a much smaller numberâ€”here the number is probably less than a hundred--that cannot be exhausted by even the very best reading you can manage...
if the book belongs to the highest class--the very small number of inexhaustible books--you discover on returning that the book seems to have grown with you.
